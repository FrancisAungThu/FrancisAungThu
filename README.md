## Hi there 👋

Data Analyst & MSc Data Science graduate (Distinction) with a strong focus on turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. My work spans predictive modelling, A/B testing, customer analytics, and end‑to‑end dashboard development, with projects built in Python, SQL, and Power BI.
I specialise in:
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and automated ETL pipelines
- Statistical analysis & experimentation (ANOVA, Chi‑Square, hypothesis testing)
- Predictive modelling for churn, LTV, segmentation, and forecasting
- Interactive dashboards that support strategic and operational decision‑making
My portfolio includes real‑world analytics projects across e‑commerce, telecom, marketing, and operational performance, each designed to demonstrate practical business impact — from identifying churn drivers to optimising product revenue and improving fulfilment efficiency.

I’m currently based in London and actively building advanced analytics projects that combine machine learning, scenario modelling, and BI storytelling. Always open to collaboration, feedback, and new ideas.
